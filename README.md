# Phase 4 Project
This project will train a model to identify patients with pneumonia based off their chest x-rays.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Tensorflow

## Data Setup
Due to the size of the data (being thousands of images) the data will not be uploaded directly to the repository. The data can be retrieved from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3. Upon downloading the data, you want to place the `chest-xray` folder into a `data` folder in the project root so the file structure looks like so:
```
data/
    train/
        normal/
        pneumonia/
    test/
        normal/
        pneumonia/
notebooks/
    ...
README.md
```
## Data Training
The best place to look at for this information would be the Jupyter Notebook itself.
